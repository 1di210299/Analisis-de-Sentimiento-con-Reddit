"In fairness, several of the countries that spend a lot on health care also lean heavily on the US for defense.  

If we stopped our defense spending, they would have to increase their own defense spending, and probably would then find they didn't have as much money to spend on healthcare anymore.",Positive,Positive

"So, ""not for profit"" doesn't mean no one is making money. It generally means that gains aren't being paid out to shareholders, and are instead reinvested internally. So, as to why anyone would work in it, Non profits pay their employees. It's pretty much the same as a normal corporation from an employees viewpoint.

As for investment, sure, people generally don't invest in non profits in the same way as they do for profit corporations, with an expectation of financial gains. Non profits are often created by charitable endowments and grown through donations and internal reinvestment. Many other nations in the world have opted to make healthcare for all a national priority, and support their healthcare systems with taxes.

It's also worth noting that some of the largest and most prestigious healthcare orgs in the US are already non profits. Kaiser's health plan for instance. Also Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, Sutter, Stanford, swedish, Partners (Mass General and Brigham and women's) and a ton more.",Positive,Positive

"What is interesting is that amid all this cry of how bad Texas is, the infant mortality rate, the most common metric used to determine general state of health, has been decreasing:

http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db120.htm

""Several other Midwestern and Southern states with higher-than-average infant mortality rates (1,6) also experienced significant declines: Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, and Texas. States with the largest declines tended to be states with the highest rates.""

"I pulled the health-related data from the study for the United States and France (since the article questions why France did worse than the US).

[Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjXjxX7FVuhFdGxFcXQtenpXcjVpZXFmbEZsclFpWEE&hl=en_US#gid=0)

As far as I can see, out of the 18 categories they measured, France was better than the US in 10, while the US was better in 6 (they were tied for two categories).

To be fair, I don't know how these categories were weighted, and I assumed that a higher score in ""Health Sub-Index scores"" (which seems to be an aggregate of other health data) is better.

The article from TheHill doesn't make much sense when describing why France did better:

> So, why did France, the leader in healthcare rankings by the World Health Organization because of its universal healthcare system and top-notch prevention efforts, end up in seventh place? 

> Thirty percent of French people ""report feeling worried during the previous day, well above the global average,"" the index reports. And despite the 35-hour work week, ""a relatively low 67 percent reported being well-rested.""

First of all, these two categories are self-reported results, so take that for what it's worth. Secondly, if we look at the data, more Americans report feeling worried (33% vs 30%), and in the ""well-rested"" category, the French are only off by 4 percentage points (67% vs 71%).

If anything, the Health sub-index scores are the only numbers that are leaning in favor of the US, but since I don't know how they're weighted or even what scale they're based on, I can't tell by how much.

Now look at the cost of healthcare per person: we pay almost exactly twice as much per person. This is all coming from their data.

One was formerly employed in the office copier industry and the other sold home improvements (window replacements, vinyl siding).  Both individuals are charming, good looking, and persuasive.

"> Infant mortality is very high, life expectancy is low, etc...

Those are lifestyle and cultural indicators, not healthcare indicators. America has a high immigrant population, which explains the infant mortality. It also has the worlds fattest, most drug and alcohol abusing population, which explains the life expectancy. The best way to improve the infant mortality rate is to tighten immigration (which would be bad overall for many other reasons). And the best way to improve the life expectancy would be to legalize drugs (which would be totally awesome). 

In first world countries, hospitals do not have even 1/100th the influence on life expectancy as does lifestyles choices. If you want to compare first world countries' healthcare quality, you have to look at more direct metrics like recovery from cancers, diseases, strokes, organ transplants, infection control, research breakthroughs, and even ratios like MRI machines per 1000 people. The US leads in all of those.",Positive,Positive

"We should have left it up to the people to quarantine? Holy shit we'd have at least a million dead by now. You're okay with that? Just because it was a million people with preexisting conditions and weak immune systems huh?

And the medical workers would be getting sick and burned out like crazy with some more losing their own lives.

This is what it would look like if we just let the virus play its course. If you ask me we should have done a stricter quarantine much sooner and we'd be in much better shape right now.

I have wealthy patients who haven't paid in 6 months...People wonder why the cost is so high bit nobody brings up the fact that insurance companies boast PROFITS each year. those profits come from you paying premiums and them dropping you or not paying because you said something slightly different than their criteria. 

If you want change, start with insurance reform(not giving it to everyone, but how it operates in general). we should also change school curriculums so people aren't obese at 18 with 20 medical problems by 30 all due to lifestyle, this is a huge drain especially since so many people are noncompliant with medications.

"The big underlying problem is that people clearly don't understand how insurance works. All the insured people pay into a pool and then the people who need a payout tap into the pool. If everyone taps into the pool either the pool runs out or everyone must pay more to keep the pool going. This defeats the purpose. The culture has to shift to being actually healthy and only tapping into the insurance pool when truly sick or injured. Being fat, abusing pills, eating horribly, never exercising, etc. shouldn't be the standard way of life. Since it is though I kinda wish people would just STFU about health care. If you like to drive 100 mph and crash your car every weekend should everyone else pay to fix it? Hell no, that's your problem for being stupid.

No, it's fucked up because the conversation/debate/discussion revolves around coverage and eligibility when it needs to be about COST.  Everybody ignores the real elephant in the room, skyrocketing cost. 

I realize healthcare is important, but the problem gets worse if the cost goes up another 125% attempting to make eligibile an additional 30-40 million individuals.
