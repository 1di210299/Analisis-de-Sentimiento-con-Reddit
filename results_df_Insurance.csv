"Hey folks, the cranberry juice thing? You want to be drinking the pure unsweetened stuff. Lots of sugar, whether from cane, corn, or other juices (usually white grape) as found in the cranberry ""juice cocktails"", will actually feed the infection.

France is [much more expensive](http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/gmaps_rankings_country.jsp?year=2013) to live in, so these lower healthcare costs can be meaningless to most people when they look at how much money they have at the end of the year.

"> Infant mortality is very high, life expectancy is low, etc...

Those are lifestyle and cultural indicators, not healthcare indicators. America has a high immigrant population, which explains the infant mortality. It also has the worlds fattest, most drug and alcohol abusing population, which explains the life expectancy. The best way to improve the infant mortality rate is to tighten immigration (which would be bad overall for many other reasons). And the best way to improve the life expectancy would be to legalize drugs (which would be totally awesome). 

In first world countries, hospitals do not have even 1/100th the influence on life expectancy as does lifestyles choices. If you want to compare first world countries' healthcare quality, you have to look at more direct metrics like recovery from cancers, diseases, strokes, organ transplants, infection control, research breakthroughs, and even ratios like MRI machines per 1000 people. The US leads in all of those.",Positive,Negative

"Actually you're both right and wrong. Cranberry juice HAS been shown to have a significant effect in reducing the frequency and severity of UTIs, by preventing bacteria from ""sticking"" to the lining of the urethra and bladder. In case of a severe UTI, such as one causing pain and bleeding, then the OP should definitely see a doctor to get it treated.

I have wealthy patients who haven't paid in 6 months...People wonder why the cost is so high bit nobody brings up the fact that insurance companies boast PROFITS each year. those profits come from you paying premiums and them dropping you or not paying because you said something slightly different than their criteria. 

If you want change, start with insurance reform(not giving it to everyone, but how it operates in general). we should also change school curriculums so people aren't obese at 18 with 20 medical problems by 30 all due to lifestyle, this is a huge drain especially since so many people are noncompliant with medications.

"It is. And one of the issues is probably that a significant number of the mothers who DO experience some level of emergency with their childbirth are probably that way because of a lack of health insurance, leading to a lack of prenatal care.

"Insurance or health care, what is the actual bottom line? For me, getting the best care possible is what is important. Insurance companies have been killing people for decades in the USA, through fine print and denial for various reasons. All in the name of business and sales. Most of the civilized world has a successful single payer system. If the USA had single payer, this conversation would be moot. The USA and it's chamber of commerce has chosen to make health care a business, rather than a system of care. Profit over the health and well being of the people. Pay the middle man at the expense of the sick.

Business and sales over health care is morally wrong. If you don't agree, you are obviously in the business of selling insurance, or you are associated some other special interest that has no interest in making a better world for the majority.",Positive,Positive
This writer doesn't know the difference between medicare and medicaid! Are you kidding me ... what an expert.,Positive,Positive
"The MD *pays* them himself, or *bills her* for private pay? 

Here's why I ask. If he is on your insurance panel, he is not allowed, by contract, to bill for any covered service above and beyond the copays/coinsurance/deductible allowed by your plan. 

So, look at your copy of your bills. Which, if you are paying for, I believe you are entitled to. If your deductible is met, and the service is covered by your insurance (such as a blood draw to check for diabetes or high cholesterol), and he bills more than your copay, you can talk to the MDs biller and report him to the insurance company. 

At this stage, it sounds like you should be talking to a lawyer anyway. If it's going to get nasty, s/he can tell you how to go about legally requesting copies of medical records. That or you hire a private detective or take the day off of work to follow your wife when she goes to appointments. 

If he *pays* them himself, that is beyond weird. Never heard of it. 
Although you can call and see if your wife has an appointment. Double check the website, but I'm pretty sure they can share that and bills. They may even have a place to Q & A what you want for those pieces. 

You need an attorney more than you need HIPAA. I'm sorry you are dealing with this. ",Positive,Positive
