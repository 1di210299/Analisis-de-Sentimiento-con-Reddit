"/u/middleagedouchebag has a good reference,  also documented in the book ""Children of the Decree,""  and I started to create some links from here: r/CitationRequired/comments/106cow9/romania_is_one_of_the_fiercest_defenders_of/ which links to the chart showing the rise/fall of maternal mortality and the discussion on reddit from those who saw it first hand.",Positive,Positive
"I'm all support for this community, but I'm just not into putting a permanent ink on your skin to keep reminding you that you have that kind of illness. It's synonymous to saying that you'll have the illness permanently when in fact you can get cured or perhaps is cured already. But this is just my opinion.   ",Positive,Positive

"I think part of the aim here is to de-stigmatize mental illness. It's extremely common and not something to be ashamed of any more than having a broken arm. 

Everybody knows someone who's fighting an internal battle, though many do not realize it. People are more empathetic simply knowing a friend in that situation. ",Negative,Negative

"What is the problem? It ""poorer"" countries are very much totally dependent on the richter countries because they have been made totally dependent in every way by the very abusive types of people who would also be complaining if all the vaccines were given to the poorer countries because then it would be testing the vaccine on poorer countries. It's total abusiveness, psychopathic abusive people that will NEVER be satisfied no matter what you do and no matter what you do will always be the wrong thing to them. TOTAL ABUSIVENESS!",Negative,Negative

"That can be viewed as ""meanie head capitalists taking advantage of poor people"" or ""rich people insuring that there are any doses at all"".  Because without those back orders, it is likely that these companies couldn't develop a vaccine.  There is no law saying that the European Union countries can't give it away to some poor country.    


There is a law saying that the vaccines would never exist if the rich European countries hadn't pre-paid for their share.  That law is that people can't work for nothing and need to buy groceries just like everyone else.",Positive,Negative
That’s their goal: they actively want to punish women for having any sort of sex outside of a man’s control.,Negative,Negative
"Interestingly - there's 

* a correlation between restricting access to abortion-related health care and a dramatic rise in maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity. 

* a correlation between maternal mortality and child sex trafficking. 

So banning abortion leads to increases in human trafficking. It's one of the reasons Romania is so strongly pro-mother's-life (e.g. pro choice) now.",Positive,Negative
